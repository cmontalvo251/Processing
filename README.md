Processing Apps over the years

agarmyo - Based on the fun actual game called agar.io

ScreenCaptureCode - This is to be used with the Ambient Lighting Arduino module. If you use it byitself it will just make a box that changes color according to your screen

Langton's Ant - The ant moves forward and turns if the cell is alive or not. The system is chaotic up to about 10000 iterations but then randomly converges to a repeatable scenario. I wonder if you can make it chaotic with an extra rule or something.

Conway's Game of Life - Each cell has rule based on neighbors and are documented in the code. Pretty cool simulation

Mandelbrot - Iteration of Mandelbrot sets. The speed of explosion is given a color.

Julia Sets - Use the sequence f(z) = z^2 + c except c is constant over the entire complex plane. Furthermore, z varies across the complex plane rather than starting at zero. Slightly different than Mandelbrot but very similar. Currently c is random from +-2.0+-2.0i which means you will get a different Julia set every time you run the code

Doodle - Attempting to make my own doodle program so I don't have to freaking download someone elses. Is it really that hard to just draw lines on a screen. 
Apparently yes. This program still needs a bit of work.

FreeSix - Eventually this will read information from a 6DOF sensor and move a cube around on the screen
